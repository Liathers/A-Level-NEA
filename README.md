This will contain various versions of my project as it is developed.

The project is a GUI that utilises one of 3 different encryption algorithms in order to encrypt a message. It will then send the message to different locally hosted chatrooms that use Python sockets in order to establish the connection. 

Do not expect any support related to the program.
