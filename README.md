This is my project for the AQA A-Level Computer Science NEA

It is a GUI that utilises 3 different encryption algoriths that are selectable by the user to send messages to chatrooms. These chatrooms will use python sockets in order to send the messages and establish a connection to another client.

During development all of the code will either be in [releases](https://github.com/Liathers/A-Level-NEA/releases "releases") or the [dev branch](https://github.com/Liathers/A-Level-NEA/tree/dev "dev branch").

*Do not expect any support related to the program.*

## Acknowledgements

 - The releases are different stages of the development process, meaning features will either be incomplete or non-functional
 - Spaghetti code may be a staple of this project

# Information

 - The GUI element of this project will most likely be scrapped, at least until it gets submitted to the exam board due to severe time constraints
